## Description


Write a program to plot out a simple version of the "bell curve" or "normal distribution" based on the sum of **4** random dice rolls.


## What you will learn 

After completing this program you should be able to:

- Prototype and write the implementation of a function  
- Understand array indexing
- Understand how to use loops to iterate over arrays  
- Introduce randomness into your program


## Background Information and Notes 

The "normal distribution" is a very important family of probability distributions. If you take any random event that produces numerical values, and repeat it often, the average of those values, although random, behaves in a predictable way. In this lab we are using only a small number of rolls (4), which is not infinite, but enough to yield a curve that resembles the bell curve.

Here is a sample run of your program: How many rolls do you want? 500 (this is the user input) 

```
 4: 
 5:X 
 6:XXX 
 7:XXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
 8:XXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
 9:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
10:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
11:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
12:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
13:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
14:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
15:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
16:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
17:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
18:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
19:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
20:XXXXXXXXXX 
21:XXX 
22:XX 
23: 
24:X
```

In this example, we asked the program to simulate 500 4-dice rolls. The sum was never four, the sum was five on 1 of the 500 trials, the sum was six on 3 of the trials, etc. 


## Functions

Implement functions in `includes/histogram/histogram.h`

### `int roll()`

Define a function `roll()` that takes no arguments, and returns a random integer from 1 to 6. Before proceeding further, we recommend you write a short main method to test it out and make sure it gives you the right values. 


### `int generateHistogramArray()`

Implement the following function to update the histogram counts array:

```c++
void generateHistogramArray (int counts[], int rolls);
```

`int counts[]` is the int array to save the sum of points of four dices
`int rolls` is the numbers of rolling dices, for example 500


### `void printHistogram(int counts[])`

Before moving on to the logic to add up rolls and count them, we will implement a function that encapsulates the output display of our sums. You will write a function `void printHistogram(int counts[])` that takes an array of integers (assumed to be of size 21 elements), then prints out sequential labeled lines from 4 to 24 with as many `X` symbols on that line as is indicated in the appropriate element of the array (i.e. counts[i]). We start our labels at 4 since rolling 4 dice can't produce a sum of 0- 3 (i.e. index 0 of the array corresponds to roll totaling 4, index 1 to a roll totaling 5, index 2 a roll totaling 6, â€¦, and index 20 to a roll totaling 24). 

Let's test our `printHistogram` function by writing a sample `main()` that calls it. We will fill in a dummy array and just ask `printHistogram` to print it out. You should try the same and ensure your `printHistogram` is working with our dummy main(): 

```c++
int main()
{
  int testCounts[21]; // 21 options of sum of 4 dice => [4,24]
  for (int i=0; i<21; i++)
    testCounts[i] = i; // fill the array printHistogram(testCounts); //fill your method
}
```

it should produce the following output:

```
 4:X
 5:XX
 6:XXX
 7:XXXX
 8:XXXXX
 9:XXXXXX
10:XXXXXXX
...
24:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```


### `int main()`

Finally, write the main function of the program. (Comment out all the other test main methods you used earlier.) It should

- Ask the user for a number, call it n  
- Run n experiments, where each experiment rolls 4 dice and adds them up  
- Throughout the experiments, keeps track of how often each possible sum (from 4 to 24) occurred  
- Prints out the histogram showing how many times each sum occurred (so in total it should print out n of the X symbols)  
- Your program should give different results each time it runs. Make sure you seed the random number generator appropriately.
